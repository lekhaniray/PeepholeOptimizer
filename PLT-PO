We will just remove 
Algebraic simplifications
Dead Jumps
REdundant load/store
Strength reduction
Unreachable code
partial algorithm for peephole Optimization

convert the input to string and feed it so that we can do a simple text matching
This will help us remove redundancies

I will continue working on it and put up a fair one by tonight (hopefully)
Both are free to contribute

if(x == ' +0' | x == ' *1') // simplification
delete operation
if ( x == ' L2 :    ')
delete operation // unreachable code

if( x == 'pow( a,2)' )
replace by a*a //
